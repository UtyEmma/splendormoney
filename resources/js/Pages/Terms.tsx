                <p>Welcome to <a href="https://splendormoneyschool.com">www.splendormoneyschool.com</a> (&ldquo;Company&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;)!</p>
                <p>These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;, &ldquo;Terms of Service&rdquo;) govern your use of our website located at splendormoneyschool.com (together or individually &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) operated by www.splendormoneyschool.com.</p>

                <p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Agreements&rdquo;). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.</p>
                <p>If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but please let us know by emailing at support@splendormoneyschool.com so we can try to find a solution. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Making Use of Splendormoneyschool</strong></p>
                <p>You acknowledge and agree that splendormoneyschool and the splendormoneyschool platform are private communities, and splendormoneyschool reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or refuse service to any user, or to accept or reject student on any basis.</p>
                <p><strong>a. Become a Student</strong></p>
                <p>Subject to these terms and conditions, anyone may generally purchase products from splendormoneyschool. Purchases will require valid email addresses and phone numbers. splendormoneyschool reserves the right to deny service to anyone who, in splendormoneyschool's sole discretion, seeks refunds without justification or on a regular basis ("serial refunders"). Buyers who repeatedly or consistently seek refunds on a large number of products purchased, particularly when those products have been reviewed and received favorable ratings, may be labelled as serial refunders and denied further service. Any outstanding refunds will be issued, and service will be denied to the account holder thereafter.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, splendormoneyschool makes it simple to request refunds within the money-back window for the purchased product. If a buyer refuses to follow splendormoneyschool's approved refund procedures and the agreed-upon refund period, splendormoneyschool reserves the right to bar the buyer from using splendormoneyschool or the splendormoneyschool platform as a buyer, mentor, or affiliate in the future, and such failure to comply shall be treated as waiver. If a product is not covered by a money-back guarantee, splendormoneyschool will notify the potential buyer by posting a message on the product's sales/order page.</p>

                <p>Affiliates will receive a compensation defined as a percentage of the sales price of any product ("affiliate commission") for sales arising from those marketing and advertising efforts in exchange for their efforts in marketing and promoting products accessible in the splendormoneyschool platform.</p>
                <p>The affiliate commission for any product(s) can be set anywhere from 5% and 95% by the mentor.
